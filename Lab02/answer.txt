Question 1:
    If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 
Answer:
    Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This feature is called constructor overloading.
Question 2:
    Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Answer:
    Java is a Pass by Value programming language. When you pass a variable to a method, a new copy of the variable is created and passed to the method.
Question 3:
    After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Answer:
    The swap method swaps the references of the two objects, not the objects themselves. The references of the two objects are passed by value to the swap method. The swap method swaps the references of the two objects, but the original references in the calling method remain unchanged.
Question 4:
    After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed? 
Answer:
    Java is pass-by-value, but when passing objects, the reference copy allows modification of the object's contents!
